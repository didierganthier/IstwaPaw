# IstwaPaw
IstwaPaw is a storyline where the user changes the story with the choices he makes. Not a really long story but you can esily understand the logic. PS: the language is creole. This work has been made in Android Studio using Java.

At each page the user has 2 options, the option he chooses makes the story different. That's how it becomes interesting. You can easily clone this repo and change my story to yours. Thank you.
